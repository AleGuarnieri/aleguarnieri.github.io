These notebooks focus on data representation using python to prepare (Pandas module) and visualize (Matplotlib module) data

1) "Visualization of weather data": the purpose of this notebook is to preprocess and visualize weather data recorded by different weather stations located in a city in the USA. The final graph shows the record high and low temperatures by day over the decade 2005-2014 together with the temperatures which broke these records in 2015.

2) "Custom visualization": this notebook shows an interactive visualization that helps the reader to quickly visualize, given a certain y value, the related x value, taking into account also the error bars shown in the graph.

3) "Milan air quality analysis": this notebook is the final project of the course. I was required to ask myself a question related to any topic, find at least two datasets to answer that queation, process the data and visualize the answer. I chose to anaylze air quality data in the city where I live (Milano) and check if PM 10 and PM 2.5 pollutants' emissions are correlated

4) "Distributions & Sampling (animation)": the main purpose here is to use the animation module of matplotilb to understand the concept of probabilistic distribution and sampling
