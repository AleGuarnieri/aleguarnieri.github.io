# Data visualization - "Netflix Stocks" project

This notebook is the final guided project where I was asked to process the data with python and then use different data visualization libraries, such as seaborn or matplotlib, to analyze and visualize the outcome. Project focused on the analysis and comparison of Netflix and DowJones stock markets prices.
