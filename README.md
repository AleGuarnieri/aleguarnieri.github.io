# Welcome

## About me
I'm Alessandro, a data analyst professional working for "BIP xTech", an international consulting firm focused on Data analysis and Data Science. I am passionate about data science ðŸ“Š but not only, as I play the piano and I love arts in general. ðŸŽ¼

After an experience as a Salesforce Platform developer, I decided to move into the data science and data engineering sector a few years ago, to combine my strong background and interest about science and informatics with something useful and applicable to the real world.

You can find all the details on my background on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-g-5143679a/)

## Motivation
This repository contains a series of projects I worked or I am working on, all related to the broad topic of Data Science.
The language used to achieve the goal of each project is python and the topics covered are different but all related to 
data extraction, manipulation, analysis, modeling and visualization.

I started to build this repository to have a place where to keep all the projects done to improve and broaden my knowledge about
Python and Data Science.

### Data wrangling and visualization with Python

Projects focused on the application of Python to data science, using modules like Pandas or Matplotlib to correctly extract, visualize and interpret data

### Machine Learning with Python

Projects focused on machine learning models implementation, both supervised and unsupervised. Some are guided projects while others I carried out on my own.
