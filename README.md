### Welcome

I'm Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science ðŸ“Š and not only, as I play the piano and I love arts in general. ðŸŽ¼

After an experience as a Salesforce Platform developer, I decided to move into the data science and data engineering sector a few years ago, to combine my background and interest about science and informatics with something useful and applicable to the real world.

I strongly believe in continuous learning, so I'm sharing here the activities I do to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field.

My dream? To keep learning and use my expertise to work and volunteer in the areas in which data science can be applied, giving back what I learned and contributing to have a positive impact in our society :earth_africa:

## Machine Learning with Python

Projects focused on machine learning models implementation, both supervised and unsupervised. Some are guided projects while others I carried out on my own.

## Data manipulation and visualization with Python

In this section I uploaded some of the exercises I carried out to learn python best practices, mostly applied to the data science field
