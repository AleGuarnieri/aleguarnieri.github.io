# Ciao and welcome! 

I am Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science but not only, as I play the piano and I love arts in general.

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Physics and I've always been into science and its applications into the real world. After an experience as a Salesforce developer in Deloitte, I finally managed to delve into data science and data engineering field: the best decision I could ever take!

So let me share some of the steps I am taking to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field.

My dream? Keep learning and use my expertise to work and volunteer in the areas in which these activities can be applied, giving back what I learned and contributing to have a positive impact in our society :)

## Machine Learning

Projects focused on machine learning model implementation, both supervised and unsupervised. Some are guided projects while others I carried out on my own.
