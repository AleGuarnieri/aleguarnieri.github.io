I'm Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science ðŸ“Š and not only, as I play the piano and I love arts in general. ðŸŽ¼

After an experience as a Salesforce Platform developer, I decided to move into the data science and data engineering sector a few years ago, to combine my background and interest about science and informatics with something useful and applicable to the real world.

I strongly believe in continuous learning, so I'm sharing here the activities I do to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field. Feel free to explore or send me a comment on all the material I loaded.

My dream? To keep learning and use my expertise to work and volunteer in the areas in which data science can be applied, giving back what I learned and contributing to have a positive impact in our society ðŸ™‚

## Machine Learning with Python

Projects focused on machine learning models implementation, both supervised and unsupervised. Some are guided projects while others I carried out on my own.

## Python applied to Data Science

In this section I uploaded some of the exercises I carried out to learn python best practices, mostly applied to the data science field

### 1. Data manipulation and coding
