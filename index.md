# Welcome! 

I am Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science but not only, as I play the piano and I love arts in general. :bar_chart:

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Physics and I've always been interested in science and its applications to the real world since ever. After an experience as a Salesforce developer, I finally managed to combine my interest for science and informatics with something which can be broadly applied and I decided to delve into data science and data engineering field: the best decision I could ever take!

As I strongly believe in education and learning in every form, let me share some of the steps I am taking to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field. Feel free to explore or send me a comment on all the exercises and projects I loaded.

My dream? To keep learning and use my expertise to work and volunteer in the areas in which these activities can be applied, giving back what I learned and contributing to have a positive impact in our society :slightly_smiling_face:

## Machine Learning with Python

Projects focused on machine learning models implementation, both supervised and unsupervised. Some are guided projects while others I carried out on my own.
