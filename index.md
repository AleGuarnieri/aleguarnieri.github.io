## Ciao and welcome! 

I am Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science and everything around it.

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Physics and after an experience as a Salesforce developer in Deloitte, I decided to delve into data science and data engineering: the best decision I could ever take!

So let me share some of the first steps I am taking to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field.

My dream: use my expertise to work and volunteer givin back what I learned in the different areas in which these activities can be applied, contributing to have a positive impact in the society :)




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AleGuarnieri/aleguarnieri.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AleGuarnieri/aleguarnieri.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
