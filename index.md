## Ciao and welcome! 

I am Alessandro, a data analyst passionate about data science and everything around it.

I hold an M.Sc. in Applied Physics and after an experience as a Salesforce developer in Deloitte, I decided to delve into data science and data engineering: the best decision I could ever take!

So let me share some of the first steps I am taking to enrich my knowledge about this wonderful field.

My dream: use my expertise to work and volunteer giving back what I learned in the different areas in which these activities can be applied, contributing to have a positive impact in the society :)
