These three notebooks contain exercises from a course on applied machine learning, each one focusing on different aspects:


- "Regression and Classification" is a series of questions and answers related to building different machine learning models for regression or classification, 
trying to understand the different types of linear regression models (such as ridge or lasso) or classification models.

- "Evaluation" is focused on the different ways in which a machine learning model can be evaluated. It is a series of different questions and related answers where different 
models are trained and fit and then evaluated using for example accuracy, confusion matrix or precision-recall functions.

- "Supervised ML" is a final project where a dataset is given where I tried to preprocess the data and to build a supervised model to predict "blight violations".
It is a more interesting task as I was note guided so I could tackle the problem in the way I wanted. It will try to change approach to see if any different results come up
