These four notebooks contain exercises and a project from a course on applied machine learning, each one focusing on different aspects of Supervised Machine Learning:

1) "Intro" is a guided notebook where I was asked to create and evaluate an supervised classification model to predict breast cancer test results

2) "Regression and Classification" is a series of questions and answers related to building different machine learning models for regression or classification, 
trying to understand the different types of linear regression models (such as ridge or lasso) or classification models.

3) "Model Evaluation" is focused on the different ways in which a machine learning model can be evaluated. It is a series of different questions and related answers where different models are trained and fit and then evaluated using, for example accuracy, confusion matrix or precision-recall functions.

4) "Predicting Property Maintenace Fines" is a final project where a dataset is given where I tried to preprocess the data and to build a supervised model to predict "blight violations". It is a more interesting task as I was note guided so I could tackle the problem in the way I wanted. It will try to change approach to see if any different results come up.
