#Data science capstone project: "Date-a-Scientist"

In this notebook I summarized the capstone project of a data science and machine learning course. 

I was given a dataset and I delved into it trying to implement ML models, applying the knowledge gained during the course. 
Both implemented models are supervised, one is a classification and one a regression. 

I focused more on the process and the technicalities involved rather than the final score of the models so any further suggestion is more than welcome. 
More details can be found into the notebook
